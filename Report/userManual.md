# User Manual

## Setup

Launch the Application by running the App.java file `/src/main/java/logicsim/App.java`.

## Functionality

Clicking and dragging a component will allow you to add the Logic Gate to the Grid on the right-hand side. Each logic gate will be able to be rotated, as well as have its inputs or outputs negated. Each component will snap to the grid when dragging, and a visual shows the current position of the dragged object.
Objects placed on the grid are able to be moved with another drag and drop operation.

## Future Functionality

### Modifying Components

Rotation and editing the `not` state of each of the inputs and outputs for the object will be added.

### Wiring

Click and drag from the input-end or output-end of any component to connect wires between components.
